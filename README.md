Hey there!

Welcome to my little bouncing burger experiment! üçî‚ú®

This is a playful Python/Tkinter app where:

- **JDJ**, our original burger, bounces around the screen.
- Each time JDJ hits a wall, up to four smaller ‚Äúclone‚Äù burgers pop into existence‚Äîthen disappear again in a fun cycle.
- All burgers (yes, even the clones!) move independently, and the background color shifts to a dark random shade whenever JDJ makes contact with an edge.
